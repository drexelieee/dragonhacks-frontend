                If you do not currently have a team or idea, do not fear! Many
                hackers come in without teams or ideas. There are two methods to
                find teammates, and trust us, hacking with a team is a lot more
                fun! Team sizes have to be 2–5 people. You should be invited to
                the official DragonHacks {YEAR} Slack Group where we have a
                #teamformation channel dedicated to team formations. We will
                also be holding a team formation event before the kickoff and
                opening ceremony. Also check out the DragonHacks {YEAR} Devpost
                challenges for inspiration on what problems to tackle.
